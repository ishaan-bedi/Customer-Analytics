# Mitron Bank Credit Card Project - Insights and Analysis

## Overview

This README file provides an overview of the insights and analysis conducted for the Mitron Bank Credit Card Project. The project's primary goal is to leverage customer data and transaction data to derive meaningful insights guiding the strategic development of a new line of credit cards.

## Project Insights

### Demographic Classification

**Objective:** Classify customers based on demographics such as age group, gender, and occupation to provide insights.

**Methodology:** Segmented customer data into distinct demographic groups, revealing patterns and trends within each segment.

**Key Findings:**
- Identification of distinct demographic groups with varying spending behaviors.
- Uncovered correlations between demographics and credit card usage.

### Average Income Utilization %

**Objective:** Determine the average income utilization % of customers (avg_spends/avg_income) as a key metric for credit card usage likelihood.

**Methodology:** Calculated the average income utilization % for each customer, providing a crucial metric for evaluating their propensity to use credit cards.

**Key Findings:**
- Established a metric to gauge the likelihood of customers utilizing credit cards.
- Identified segments with higher income utilization %, indicating a greater inclination towards credit card usage.

### Spending Insights

**Objective:** Analyze spending patterns to understand where customers spend the most, considering factors like occupation, gender, city, and age.

**Methodology:** Mapped spending patterns against demographic factors to identify trends and potential correlations.

**Key Findings:**
- Unearthed insights into spending preferences based on occupation, gender, city, and age.
- Provided a foundation for tailoring credit card features to specific target groups.

### Key Customer Segments

**Objective:** Identify and profile key customer segments likely to be high-value users of the new credit cards.

**Methodology:** Integrated demographic classification, average income utilization %, and spending insights to pinpoint high-value customer segments.

**Key Findings:**
- Formulated profiles of key customer segments with a high likelihood of credit card usage.
- Gained a holistic understanding of demographics, spending behaviors, and financial preferences within these segments.

### Credit Card Feature Recommendations

**Objective:** Provide recommendations for key credit card features based on insights from the provided data and secondary research.

**Methodology:** Merged insights from the dataset with external research to propose features aligned with customer preferences and market trends.

**Key Recommendations:**
- Tailor credit card features to match the preferences of identified key customer segments.
- Incorporate features that address specific spending patterns and financial needs revealed through analysis.

### Additional Thoughts

**Objective:** Encourage further exploration of the data to uncover additional valuable insights beyond the initial findings.
